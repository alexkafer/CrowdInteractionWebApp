  We are currently playing pong on the Net Lights. Would you like to get added to the waiting list?

  <button (click)="intendToPlay()">Yes. Bring it on.</button>
</p>

<p *ngIf="(waiting | async) > 0">
      You are in position {{waiting | async }} on the waiting list. The turns will rotate once a player dies. 

      (If you want to be removed from the list, just close the window)
