<p *ngIf="(waiting | async) == -1">

  We are currently playing pong on the Net Lights. Would you like to get added to the waiting list?

  <button (click)="intendToPlay()">Yes. Bring it on.</button>
</p>

<p *ngIf="(waiting | async)">
      You are in position {{waiting | async }} on the waiting list. Turns rotate at the end of the game. 

      (If you want to be removed from the list, just close the window)
